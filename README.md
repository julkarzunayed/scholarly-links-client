### General Features

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented using custom hooks (`useUserRole`) and `react-router-dom`'s `PrivateRoute` (conceptual) to secure routes and UI elements based on user roles (e.g., `admin`, `rider`).
* **Global State Management:** Leverages `@tanstack/react-query` for efficient data fetching, caching, synchronization, and mutations, reducing boilerplate and improving performance.
* **API Communication:** Uses `axios` for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
* **User Notifications:** Integrates `sweetalert2` for visually appealing and interactive alerts, confirmations, and success/error messages.
* **Date & Time Handling:** Utilizes `date-fns` for robust date parsing, formatting, and calculations (e.g., for earnings breakdown).
* **Responsive UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components, ensuring a modern and adaptive user interface across various devices.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Implements a `ScrollToTop` component to automatically scroll the window to the top on route changes.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a generic "Forbidden" page for unauthorized access attempts.
